This is a simple position size calculator for traders.
It takes your account balance, entry price, exit price, stop loss and risk percentage to calculate the correct position size. 
It has both CLI and GUI versions. It's cross-platform and should run on Linux, MacOS and Windows or any OS with Python installed.

# How to install/use

Head to the [Releases](https://github.com/mfat/qtpositioncalc/releases) section and download the app for your operating system. Each release contains versions for Linux, Windows and MacOS plus the python script. If you're a Windows user, download the exe file.

The app requires no installation. Just download the file and run it.


You can also just download [PositionSizeCalculator.py](https://github.com/mfat/qtpositioncalc/releases/download/0.1/PositionSizeCalculator.py) and run it with python like this:
```
python PositionSizeCalculator.py
```
Disclamer: Don't rely on this app for your investemnt/trade decisions. This is just a hobby project that I have made for my personal use. The calculations shouldn't be considered financial advice.
