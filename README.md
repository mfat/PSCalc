# Introduction
This is a simple position size calculator for traders.
It takes your account balance, entry price, exit price, stop loss and risk percentage to calculate the correct position size. 
It has both CLI and GUI versions. It's cross-platform and should run on Linux, MacOS and Windows or any OS with Python installed.

# Use case
This app is intnded for traders (mainly stocks and cryptocurrency traders) that need a tool to manage their risk. It is optimized for quick data entry, and quick copy/paste from/into the app. You can navigate through the app using keyboard. Just use tab and arrow up/down keys to move between text fields quickly.

# How to install/use

Head to the [Releases](https://github.com/mfat/qtpositioncalc/releases) section and download the app for your operating system. Each release contains versions for Linux, Windows and MacOS plus the python script. If you're a Windows user, download the exe file.

The app requires no installation. Just download the file and run it.

If you're a linux user and prefer the command line, use [clicode.py](https://github.com/mfat/qtpositioncalc/blob/d75463edb18367559855df60f10d897009265b78/clicode.py)

Disclamer: Don't rely on this app for your investemnt/trade decisions. This is just a hobby project that I have made for my personal use. The calculations shouldn't be considered financial advice.
