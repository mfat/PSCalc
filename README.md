mFat Position size calculator
This is a simple position size calculator for traders.
It takes your account balance, entry price, exit price, stop loss and risk percentage to calculate the correct position size. 
It has both CLI and GUI versions. It's cross-platform and should run on Linux, MacOS and Windows or any OS with Python installed, but it was only tested on Linux.
